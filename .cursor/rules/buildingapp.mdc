# Cursor Project Rules for Cartify

You are an expert Flutter developer tasked with building an e-commerce mobile application named **Cartify**.

## 🎯 Project Goal
- Build an **Android-first** e-commerce app using Flutter.
- App should be **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready**.
- Future expansion to iOS and Web should be easy.

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines
- Design must be **modern, clean, and aesthetic** (Dribbble/Behance vibes).
- Style: minimal, lots of white space, rounded corners, soft shadows, elegant typography.
- Add smooth animations (Hero animations, fade/slide transitions).
- Color palette: suggest professional and trendy palettes (primary, secondary, accent).
- UI must give impression of a real-world modern startup app.

## Screen
- Home 
- Transaction
- Account

## 🏗️ Architecture
- Follow **Clean Architecture** principles:
  - **Domain Layer** (business logic, use cases, entities).
  - **Data Layer** (repositories, models, API/data sources).
  - **Presentation Layer** (UI, state management).
- Use **dependency injection**.
- Use **state management** that fits clean architecture (Bloc or Riverpod preferred).

## 📂 Project Structure
- Clearly define folder structure (e.g., `lib/domain`, `lib/data`, `lib/presentation`).
- Provide maintainable code conventions and file organization.

## 📦 Packages & Tools
- API handling: `dio` or `http`.
- State management: `flutter_bloc` or `riverpod`.
- Dependency injection: `get_it` or built-in Riverpod DI.
- Local database: `sqflite` or `hive` (for cart, offline data).
- UI components: `flutter_svg`, `google_fonts`, `animations`.

## 🚀 Deliverables
- Scaffold the project with clean architecture folder structure.
- Implement example screens:
  - **Product list screen** → displays product cards.
  - **Product detail screen** → shows description, price, add-to-cart button.
  - **Cart screen** → basic checkout flow.
- Include example UI code with modern design.
- Recommend at least one color palette for branding Cartify.

## 📝 Notes
- Always keep code clean and production-ready.
- Explain design & architecture choices in comments.
- Use the name **Cartify** consistently for branding.
